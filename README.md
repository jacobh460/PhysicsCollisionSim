This project is unfinished, I was planning on adding more controls for adjusting mass of each block and adding/removing blocks but never got around to it


Press "Start" to start the simulation

All collisions between blocks are treated as elastic (both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved) only energy is conserved in collisions between individual blocks and the walls on the side of the screen
